                        So close, no matter how far<br>
                        Couldn't be much more from the heart<br> 
                        Forever trust in who we are<br> 
                        And nothing else matters<br>
                        <br><br>
                        Never opened myself this way<br> 
                        Life is ours, we live it our way<br> 
                        All these words, I don't just say<br> 
                        And nothing else matters<br> 
                        <br><br>
                        Trust I seek and I find in you<br> 
                        Every day for us something new<br> 
                        Open mind for a different view<br> 
                        And nothing else matters<br> 
                        <br><br>
                        Never cared for what they do<br> 
                        Never cared for what they know<br> 
                        And I know<br>
